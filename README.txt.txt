This is a simple demonstration of Diffie–Hellman Key exchange between two hosts. For simplicity I have done the implementation with 8-bit key but it works with 1024-bit as well.
Every object has it's own publickey and privatekey. In this demonstration i have shared each others public key to generate equal keys.

How to RUN:

run the following command in CMD:
 
node dh.js
